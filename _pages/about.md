<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of <a href='https://www.mun.ca/engineering/ece/'>Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at Memorial University of Newfoundland, under the supervision of <a href='https://www.engr.mun.ca/~weimin/'>Prof. Weimin Huang</a>. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Engineering from Dalian Maritime University in 2018 and my Master's degree in Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2021, respectively.

My **research interests** lie in deep learning-based methods for remote sensing data analysis, focusing on hyperspectral images and GNSS-R data. I am especially interested in applying these methods to ocean remote sensing and developing innovative solutions for ocean-based climate change challenges. For instance, I am exploring how deep learning can be used to monitor and analyze kelp forests, which play a crucial role in marine ecosystems and are beneficial for absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
