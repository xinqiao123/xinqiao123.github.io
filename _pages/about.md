I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.mun.ca/engineering/ece/) at Memorial University of Newfoundland, under the supervision of [Prof. Weimin Huang](https://www.engr.mun.ca/~weimin/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Engineering from Dalian Maritime University in 2018 and my Master's degree in Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2021, respectively. 

If you're interested in exploring my academic and professional background in more detail, please refer to my [Curriculum Vitae](https://xinqiao123.github.io/files/Xin_Qiao_CV.pdf).
